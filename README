Some simple scripts to help give people access to git repositories without giving them full access via SSH
The directory that contains these scripts should be added to the PATH variable so they can easily be accessed.

== only_git.rb ==
This script is not directly used. It's used by SSH because of the command="" line that is inserted in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
Rather than manually adding these entries to the file, the allow_git.rb script can be used.

== allow_git.rb ==
Adds the proper SSH command="" lines to the authorized_keys file to give access to other people.
Use the -h argument to see the options.

== Example ==
Imagine I have a directory called /home/user/myrepos that has 2 git repos called one.git and two.git
Now I want to allow a friend of mine to have access to those 2 repos but I don't want him to be able to login via SSH to my server.
So I ask him for his public ssh key, and I execute the command 
   ./allow_git.rb -d /home/user/myrepos -f /home/user/keys/friend_rsa.pub
Which then adds a line to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and gives him push and pull access to repos one.git and two.git like so:
   git clone user@server.com:one.git
   git push origin master
   git fetch
   git pull
   etc.
